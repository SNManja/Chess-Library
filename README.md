# Chess-Library â™Ÿ

Remade the overall class structures, making pieces less responsable and making the pieceState administrate the overall board state.

My goal with this project is to make a library or api, with the idea of implementing my own chess webpage in the future:
* Database of historic matches
* Ability to play online (via sockets)
* Artificial intelligence to play with
* Portable game notation parser, with the idea of adding the ability to import matches without a hustle
